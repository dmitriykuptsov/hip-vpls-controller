\chapter{Introduction}

The roots of the Internet are back in 70's. Back then the Internet was rather 
small network and was interconnecting major universities, military and governmental
organizations. Today the Internet is a sophisticated network comprising billions 
of devices. 

As the Internet evolved so did the need for the security. Modern Internet 
contains colossal number of legacy devices which are not capable to perform 
cryptographic operations and so special solutions are required to protect 
sensitive data which is passed over the wire from such attacks as 
Man-In-The-Middle, message forgery, impersonation attack, etc.

The solution is to employ the so called Virtual Private LAN service with message
encryption and authentication. With this idea in mind in this work we are going 
to demonstrate the HIP-VPLS solution which uses Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
and IPSec for securing data-plane traffic, and SSL for communication with 
central server - configurator - for protecting the control plane traffic. 

We have already described the HIP-VPLS solution in our previous work (for reference
see~\cite{hipvplspython}). Here, the main focus is on the complete architecture and configurator
user interface.
